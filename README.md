# Frontend Practice Project

## Description

This is a page built from the [Abstract Project][abstract] design at
[Frontend Practice][frontend].

Although I followed the design most of the way, I became more interested in:
- working out how to use SVG Sprites,
- breaking down Javascript into modules, and
- coordinating CSS Media queries and Javascript to control the mobile menu,

than absolute fidelity to the design.

## HTML

- `template` used for individual 'cards'.
- `dialog` element used for 'Sign in' and 'Submit request' forms.

## CSS

- `flexbox` is used for the overall page layout and many of the page elements.
- `grid` is used only for the 'cards' section.
- Responsive.

## SVGs

- I used an SVG sprite to pull in most of the icons.
- The mobile navigation hamburger icon is written inline.

## Fonts

- The Google font, 'Roboto', is self-hosted (see my [self-hosting-fonts][fonts] page).

## Javascript

- ES6 modules
- ES6 (no transpilation to ES5)

## JSON

- To simulate a database I've pulled in the individual cards via `cards.json`.

## Accessibility
- `ARIA` and `role` attributes used as required.
